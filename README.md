# Omniture Log Analysis

#### Business Problem/Objective
Web analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of web data for purposes of understanding and optimizing web usage. However, Web analytics is not just a process for measuring web traffic but can be used as a tool for business and market research, and to assess and improve the effectiveness of a website

#### Clickstream Data  
Clickstream data is an information trail a user leaves behind while visiting a website. The data is normally extracted from log files and cookies into the database and then analysts can make inferences using different business models. It is typically captured in semi-structured website log files.
 
These website log files contain data elements such as 
- Date and time stamp
- Visitor’s IP address
- The destination URLs of the pages visited, and
- User ID that uniquely identifies the website visitor. 

### Potential Uses of Clickstream Data

 One of the original uses of Hadoop at Yahoo was to store and process their massive volume of clickstream data. Now enterprises of all types can use Hadoop and the Cloudera to refine and analyze clickstream data.   
They can then answer business questions such as:
- What is the most efficient path for a site visitor to research a product, and then buy it? (Path Optimization)
- What products do visitors tend to buy together, and what are they most likely to buy in the future? (Association Analysis & Next product to buy)
- Where should I spend resources on fixing or enhancing the user experience on my website? (Allocation of website resources)
